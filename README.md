## Motivation
I was scanning through projects I can implement to [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) for practice and to improve my skills, then I landed on one where I had to utilize an API. This interested me as I already knew alot about creating APIs in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and had on several occasions used APIs with Vanilla JavaScript. Therefore, I wanted to try out my hands and use [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) to implement
