# Quiz âš›ðŸ¤”

## About
The quiz app is a react application. It consumes an open source API provided by [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php)

## Motivation
I was scanning through projects I can implement to React.js for practice and to improve my skills, then I landed on one where I had to utilize an API. This interested me as I already knew alot about creating APIs in Node.js and had on several occasions used APIs with Vanilla JavaScript. Therefore, I wanted to try out my hands and use React.js to implement

## Framework
This project is fully implemented in React.js

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/ojokne/quiz.git
